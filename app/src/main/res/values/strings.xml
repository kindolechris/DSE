        Some of us wants to be financially successful by investing in shares listed in the stock market and probably make a fortune out of it. But, somehow our financial literacy constraints us from achieving such objective. Well, as I indicated in the last week’s article financial literacy is a necessary part of the saving and investment process, and therefore as you map out your action plan for getting there, financial education should be part of that map. In this article I will share with you a few suggestions on investing in shares and portfolio management.
        The first thing you need to consider in deciding on whether you are ready to invest in shares is to look at your current financial circumstances. Some of us have goals, which are a good start, but we need to see if we can actually afford the investment required to realize our goals. In other words, you need to determine if you have the spare/surplus cash to make investments in shares.
        To achieve that you need to construct your personal balance sheet and seek answers to some important questions to see where you stand.
        Under normal circumstances, only once you have paid off all your obligations and paid for all your important expenses and you still have income (savings) left-over should you consider investing in shares. Therefore, first thing you need to consider, is to settle your expenses and pay outstanding high interest debts. This is not a rule but it is a prudent advice because if you have debts that costs you say 20 per cent in interest per annum and if you are to use that money for investing in shares, your shares investment returns should be growing at more than 20 percent per annum so that, at some stage you can sell the share to repay the debts and still remain with some profits. If that will be the case then you are doing very well, but this is often difficult to achieve and thus it is advisable or rather recommendable for you to take a simple approach, which says invest your savings, do not borrow or get into debts trying to make investments in shares – because the moment you do that, that will be speculation.
        I know some retail/private individual investors who in some cases take the approach of borrowing for the purpose of investing in shares during Initial Public Offering (IPOs); where they borrow from banks with the speculative motives that after the IPO and share have been listed in the stock market for trading, then immediately prices will go up and they will be able to liquidate their investment positions, pay the debt and retain some profits. In some few cases they are successful and, in many cases, they are not successful.

        Having achieved the act of careful analysis of where is your financial position, you then need to have a closer look at your attitude towards risk. This will help you see where you would like to be in the future.
        So, what kind of things do you need to look into? Here are some points you need to consider: (i) Age and the time remaining for you to continue working before retirement – as well as how much time do you have to achieve your goals? (ii) Occupation and employment status – do you have job security and a reliable income, or are you self-employed or a pensioner?; (iii) Standard of living – what are your ongoing requirements for an enjoyable standard of living, including personal belongings, holidays and luxury (entertainment) items? Are you comfortable now? Are you able to budget?; (iv) Family and dependents – do you wish to provide for your children and dependents’ education or for other needs?; (v) Need for financial independence – do you have a strong need for financial independence and don’t wish to rely on a pension upon retirement?; (vi) Personal control – how much control do you like to have in managing your financial situation?; (vii) Insurance – do you have adequate insurance against risks to your property, possessions, income and wellbeing?
        I suggest you speak to a financial or investment advisor to assess this if you do not have the objectivity or knowledge to do so.
        Funding your share investment: If you’re going to invest money in shares, the first thing you need is money. In the paragraphs above I’ve proposed that you consider investing in shares if you have surplus income/savings. However, you may to also note that for some many investors, reallocating their investments does the trick.
        Reallocating simply means selling some investments or other assets and reinvesting that money into shares. It boils down to deciding what investment or asset you should sell. Generally, you want to consider those investments and assets that give you a low return on your money. Re-allocation is only part of the answer; your cash flow is the other part.
        Your cash flow refers to what money is coming in (income) and what money is being spent (outflows). The result is either a positive cash flow or a negative cash flow, depending on your cash management skills. Maintaining positive cash flow helps to increase your net worth.
        Lastly, it is important that you set the right expectations and learn what to expect from the share (stock) market, learn to evaluate and analyze businesses that you intend to invest into. Most of these information and data can be obtained from the companies’ published financial statements; also company news and releases might assist. Historical precedents and information related into it are also things to consider, as it is history tends to repeat itself in the share market.
        Macroeconomics and Shares Performance
        There are several factors that influence the share price performance and the level of return (capital gain) for investors in listed shares. Key factors are: (1) demand and supply factors; (2) economic variables i.e. GDP,
        inflation, interest rates and exchange rate; (3) company news on corporate actions; and (4) psychological or market cycle-related factors. In today’s article, we will focus on the economic variables, read on:
        A company’s value, return and share price reflect the perception of its earnings and profit flow. If the stock market detects something about a company that may harm its earnings flow, the company’s share price falls. If the stock exchange hears good news about the company — i.e. its current earnings, new innovations or discoveries that have future earnings growth potential, leadership enhancement, etc — its share price rises.
        Share prices change because sellers and buyers are constantly reviewing companies’ news and especially its earnings prospects. Out of the two factors that determine a change in share prices – future expectations of earnings and the price to earnings multiples, both of these factors depend on an evaluation from buyers and sellers as they learn more about, and understand the listed companies.
        Apart from fundamental performance-related factors, investors are also looking at other market information, including economic news (such as economic growth, inflation, changes in exchange rates, change in interest rates, etc) and political aspects that can cause share prices to rise or fall. In the short term, the share price is also affected by intangible factors such as hype, rumors, and word-of-mouth.
        Share prices performance on companies listed in the DSE, like other stock markets, are also influenced by what happens in other markets and economies. If there is a substantial fall in other markets prices and indices, Tanzanian share prices are likely to be under pressure as well, mainly because of foreign investors participation in our market. Foreign investors contribute over 90 percent of DSE trading activities and owns a large part of companies listed.
        The stock market activities and performance largely depend on the state of the economy and its activities. Economic conditions directly affect companies’ earnings and earnings prospects. Therefore, economic news is as an important influence on the share market activities and performance. Economic statistics that affect the share market are:
        • Official interest rate, dictated by both financial markets and Central Bank
        • Inflation rate or the rate of increase in consumer prices
        • Rate of growth of the economy — Gross Domestic product (GDP)
        • Exchange rate, or how the Shilling fares against other currencies
        • The health of other key economies
        Interest rates and inflation
        Interest rates affect companies’ earnings directly because their debt repayment costs rise and fall with the interest rate changes.
        Interest rates determine how much it costs to borrow or what one can receive in an investment. A rise in interest rates increases the attractiveness of fixed interest investments (such as bonds) relative to shares. High interest rates also increase a company’s borrowing cost, it means taking money directly from profit to pay the bankers. Rising interest rates also affect the level of economic activity and consumer spending.
        Alterations to interest rates are part of monetary policy, a tool that Central Banks wields from time to time in relation to economic activity. Like any central bank, the Bank of Tanzania lifts interest rates to choke off any stirring of inflation, as a result of bubbling economic activity.
        During a period of tight liquidity, interest rates rise increases production costs. Conversely, interest rates fall when there is ample liquidity. People have more purchasing power, which is positive for business expansion and share investment. During these times, interest rates are used as tools for mopping up excessive liquidity.
        Inflation simply refers to how much the prices of the goods and services that you buy go up by each year. It is usually written as a percentage. One of the reasons that people invest in the share market is to try and beat inflation.
        The stock market dislikes inflation: inflation pushes up costs for companies quicker than it can pass them on to customers, adversely affecting earnings. Conversely, when a central bank believes that economic growth needs to be stimulated or an economic decline reversed, it will cut interest rates.
        Historically, low inflation has had a strong inverse correlation with valuations (low inflation drives high multiples, and high inflation drives low multiples). Deflation, on the other hand, is generally bad for shares because it signifies a loss in pricing power for companies.
        The GDP
        Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the value of all goods and services produced in the economy. When GDP decreases, the economy contracts and companies’ earnings fall and when GDP increases, the economy expand, and companies’ earnings rises. Therefore, any prospects of positive economic (GDP) outlook will attract investors in the shares of companies operating in such an economy — but the opposite is also true, prospects of negative outlook in the economic activities will reduce investments in shares listed in such an economy.
        The health of the key economies
        Foreign investors accounts for about 90 percent of the DSE’s activities and over 60 percent of listed shares ownership. Since economic performance and health of other key economies affecting the domestic stock market, this is a concern. The case of COVID-19 pandemic, the tightening global financial conditions, decline in prices of exports and disruptions of economic activities on the backdrop of adopting measures to manage the spread of the pandemic affects market indices, price volatility and returns for listed securities especially for the kind of our markets which overly depend on foreign investors for liquidity and market activity.

          The second quarter of every year is the period where companies announce their annual performances and plans to pay dividends to their shareholders based on the previous year performance. This is also the time where Annual General Meetings (AGMs) of shareholders are also called, and where key statutory decisions about companies are made. This is the time where active, intelligent and energetic shareholders actively engage the Board and managements about the conduct, strategy and performance of their companies. This is the time where shareholders demand clear and satisfying explanations when the performance results appear to be less than they should be. It is also the time for shareholders to support movements towards improved performance, but also remove unproductive directors and indirectly management from governing or managing companies.

        Unfortunately, in often cases shareholders do not understand that such crucial roles are theirs. Instead, when something has gone wrong with a listed company, or where there are sketchy details about what is happening with a company – investors/shareholders tend to think, it is either the role of the capital markets regulator or the stock exchange to right the wrongs. This kind of thinking is largely wrong, even though it also has some truths — I will explain:

        One of the core mandates for the regulator and the stock market, as it relates to the above context, is to promote investor education, public awareness and sensitizing interest in the capital markets products from the public. The aim real is to ensure that shareholders gain the necessary skills in and understanding in line with the governance system of the companies they have invested into so as to hold directors and management accountable in the manner in which they execute their mandates, being stewards of shareholders’ and others interests in the company.

        Apart from investor education regulators and exchanges also have the role of carrying out an assessment of continuing listing obligations as stipulated in the regulations and rules of the regulator and the stock market. They also carry assessments on the proposed issuance of securities (shares, bonds, etc) to the public prior to raising capital or listing these securities into the stock market. Such assessment seeks to establish the extent to which the envisaged securities offer meets the eligibility requirements for capital raising from the public and for listing into the stock exchange.
        As it were, prior to issuance of securities to the public, the issuer is required to prepare the prospectus or information memorandum that provide details of the prospective security and disclosure of the relevant information that will help investors understand the nature of the security on offer, the company behind the security on offer, its strategies, its financial wellbeing, its future outlook, its risks and risk mitigation as well as its governance and control mechanisms.

        During the Prospectus approval process the regulator and the exchange gets an opportunity to interrogate the company’s board and management as to the facts stated in the prospectus, challenge their assumptions, ask for details or seek clarification on matters that requires elaborations or detailed disclosures. Once satisfied, the regulator and the exchange approve the prospectus ready for capital raising and listing of securities. Up to this stage, the investing public is not so much engaged. Their involvement and engagement start thereafter.

        So, what is the role of a shareholder? I started by indicating that most shareholders tend to think that the regulator or the exchange has a key role as to the performance outcomes or governance of companies. The truth is that shareholders contribute to the success or failure of the company to meet its performance and governance expectations. But what happens is that some shareholders lose touch with the company soon as the Initial Public Offering (IPO) process. Nevertheless, shareholders are required to increase their engagement with the company soon after the IPO process; why and how?

        Shareholders elects the board to represent their interest to the company. The board then delegates this mandate to management —however the board retains the responsibility of ensuring that there is a smooth business operations, governance and risk management mechanisms throughout the company.

        By attending in AGMs, shareholders get an opportunity to make major decisions impacting their rights, exercising their ultimate control over the company and how it is governed and managed, as well as engaging on other matters of interest to shareholders — this includes selection of the members of directors, appointment of external auditors, approval of audited accounts, etc.

        When shareholders’ role is not fulfilled companies face bad results which then disappoints shareholders who end up selling their shares at low prices or not getting returns (including dividends) from their investments. The idea is active shareholders could real help themselves by supporting moves of improving companies by making their presence left at annual meetings

                We started the week with some good news, as reports from major global media houses read: “Stock markets in Asia and Europe started this week on the front foot, this was after positive news on the slowing rate of deaths in France and Italy which appeared to give investors hope that the coronavirus lockdown measures are bearing fruits. Share indices rose strongly in Japan, Australia, Hong Kong and Korea, amid signs that the lockdowns imposed on countries around the world have indeed slowed the spread of the disease. Korea, Italy and France all reported numbers over the weekend that suggested the spread had slowed. But Chinese stocks dipped in Shanghai and Shenzhen”.
        This is all good news until you consider the side of investment analysts and advisers, for instance when the above was being report, the rejoinder from some economists in major investment banks noted, according to their analysis, that there is still significant uncertainty over when countries will return to some semblance of normal functioning, and hence markets should not be too optimistic.
        Now, that says something — and this is where this article will focus, the role of investment advisers to investors and investment markets, especially in challenging and uncertain times – i.e. during global pandemic, or financial collapse, or a potential/actual world war, or a failure in agreement in dealing with climate change, or etc.
        It is a fact that so far year 2020 has been a trying year for the humanity in whatever angle you look at it. From the investment and financial markets context, traders and investors have so far lost billions of dollars due to large trading and investment losses and yes, they are both financially and emotionally affected. And as the corona virus pandemic continue to spark wild swings in the financial markets, investors and traders are becoming all the more desperate and fearful. Understandably, experiencing this situation has taken an emotional toll on the investing and trading community. But as defeating as these losses feel, how one reacts to such losses and the advice/news related them is as important, probably more than the loss itself. I will explain.
        Since the business of investment money in securities is unique among business operations in that it is almost always based in some degree of advice received from others, it is thus important that some degree of carefulness be excised. Carefulness should be exercised when in the process of seeking advice, especially if the advice sought is related to ways of making “huge” profits. Now, it is natural that many businessmen seek professional advice on various elements of their businesses, but seldom should be the case for a businessman to expect to be told by advisers on how to make huge profits whether during predictable or during crisis times, doesn’t matter. But then if we assume that there are normal results that are expected to be obtained from investing money in securities, then the role of advisers can be rightly established. That is, s/he will use their superior knowledge, experience and skills to protect his/her clients against mistakes of perceptions and in the process enable the investor obtain the results to which their money is entitled.
        But then when it comes to investment in securities, where do potential investors expect to obtain their advice? Well, there are many sources, these include: (i) a relative or friend, presumably knowledgeable on investing in securities; (ii) a banker; (iii) a brokerage firm (or in some other places investment banking houses); (iii) a licensed investment and financial adviser; (iv) in some cases – accountants, lawyers, rating agencies; (v) books, periodicals, blogs; (vi) etc. However, probably the largest volume of information and advice to investors in securities comes from stockbrokers. Let’s expound on this:
        Stock brokerage houses are firms which are members of stock markets who execute buying and selling orders from their clients for regulated commissions. Their staff member are trained by the industry regulator and the stock market on, among others are matters of securities research and analysis and are therefore expected to be capable to make securities recommendation to their clients, such recommendations must be informed by proper research and analysis on an economy, sectors within the economy and on particular companies and securities. Members of staff of brokerage houses are also expected to hold themselves in high professional and ethical standards.
        Stock brokers are expected to confine their activities to executing orders given to them by their customers (investors), to supply information and analyses, and to rendering opinions on investment merits of securities, but since some customers want speculative advice and suggestions from their stockbrokers – some of the brokers finds themselves in speculative activities, as opposed to their professional mandates. That is, even though in some few cases investors and brokerage houses may thrive on speculation activities, but still brokerage houses are expected to operate on a thoroughly professional basis.
        In any way investment advisers should not speculate with investors needs for information or their investing money especially in challenging times. It is in their best interest to help protect their customers against financial losses – times like these are when advisers are needed most, but their advice should be based on the information that is well researched and properly analyzed.

    <string name="value_vs_price">
                When contemplating to invest in shares, what factors determines how much you should be willing to pay for a share? What makes one company’s shares to be worth several times compared to another? How can you as investor be reasonably sure that you are not overpaying for an apparent promising future, which could as well turn out to be a nightmare? Benjamin Graham in his 1949 famous investment book, The Intelligent Investor mentions five aspects that he feels are key decisive elements in responding to some of the above questions: (i) the company’s “general long-term prospects”; (ii) the quality of its management; (iii) the financial strength and capital structure; (iv) its dividends payment records; and (v) its current dividend rate. In today’s article we will explore these five key investment aspects in light of our current market challenges, as investors are in a panic mode and markets are losing value significantly. What we are about to learn (and mostly from that book) is that even in trying times for economies ad financial markets, value investors (as opposed to speculators) can still maintain their safety, or even increase their worth from investment. Let’s elaborate:
        The long-term prospects: in recent days, investors have been so keen in following up about movements of share, of course since January to-date the movement has been on the downward direction across all markets. For speculative or aggressive investors and stock traders perspective this isn’t good news at all. But for a “value and defensive investor” this should be the time to download at least five years’ worth of annual reports for some listed companies (which are obtainable in the DSE website). Then go through the financial statements gathering evidence that will help you answer the following two overriding questions: what makes the company grow? where do (and where will) its profits come from? As you study the sources of growth and profits, pay attention on the competitive advantage of the company as well, where is it relative to its short-versus-long term plans? whether the company invest in long-term development activities i.e. its people, brand, research and development, etc; or overly reliance in short term unsustainable plans.
        The quality and conduct of management: one of the most important leadership traits is trustworthy, company leaders should state what they intend to do during a period of time, and then follow up on their commitments. To appreciate this, read the past annual reports, see what plans and forecasts company executives made, if they fulfilled them or if they fell short. And, if they fell short what were the reasons, did they externalize their short comings? are they seem responsible and accountable or do they rather blame things like “the economy”, or
        “the uncertainty”, or “weak demands”? These questions can help you to determine whether the people who runs the company are acting on the shareholders (and other stakeholders’) interest, or their own interests.
        The Financial strength and capital structure: one of the basic possible ways of looking into a business which is well and sustainably run is in finding out if the business is making cash profits i.e. if cash generated revenues exceeds what the company consumes. Under normal circumstances good business managers keeps finding ways of putting that surplus cash into productive use which also helps the company to continue enhancing its value. But how would you know this?– read the statement of cash flow, which is part of the financial statements in the annual reports. See if cash from operating activities has grown steadily in the period under review, or not?. The other element to look into is the earnings or profits per shares, is it growing? As for the capital structure, this can be seen from the balance sheet. Draw your attention onto the amount of debts that the company is obliged to pay, under normal circumstances the amount of debts should not exceed 50 percent of total capital for the company. If it exceeds such levels, you should question, because the company could end up being owned by debt holders instead of shareholders. Also, on the notes to the financial statements, observe as to whether interest rates of debts are fixed or variable – this has an impact on the profitability of the business.
        The last aspect that a “defensive investor” or “value investor” is expected to pay attention into is the historical dividend records as well as the current dividend rates. What is dividend? dividends are a form of cash flow to the investor. Dividends are an important reflection of a company’s value. It is important to note also that shares with dividends are less likely to reach unsustainable values. Investors have long known that dividends help companies from declining in value.
        Despite of the above, there is an argument that, usually companies pay dividends because that could be the best use of their cash; that growth companies looking to capture more market share would not pay dividends instead they would invest their cash profits in innovation and looking to provide appreciation to their assets instead of giving money to shareholders. In either case, from the practical aspects of the investors and markets, companies that pay cash dividends are highly perceived to bring more value addition to investors and hence enhancing shareholders’ value compared to companies that do not pay dividends.
        Based on the above, it can be said that in investing as with life in general, the ultimate victory goes to those who are willing to devote a considerable amount of efforts to their undertakings, those who does things and know where they are going. As Yogi Bela once said: “you’ve got to be careful if you don’t know where you’re going, because you might not get there”. During these times where markets are trading on the low, you better know where you are going with the actions you take. Either way, try not to speculate.
